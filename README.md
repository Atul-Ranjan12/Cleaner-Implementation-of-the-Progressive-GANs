# Cleaner-Implementation-of-the-Progressive-GANs
This is an attempt for cleaner implementation of Progressive GANs in Tensorflow Keras


Checklist:
1) Create The generator and discriminator and design it such that it is adaptive to multiplying resolutions 
2) Create the loss functions 
3) Create the training loop 
4) Test on CIFAR
