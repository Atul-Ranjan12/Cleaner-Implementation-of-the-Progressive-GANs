# Cleaner-Implementation-of-the-Progressive-GANs-Paper
This is an attempt for cleaner implementation of Progressive GANs in Tensorflow Keras


Checklist:
1) Create The generator and discriminator and design it such that it is adaptive to multiplying resolutions 
2) Create the loss functions 
3) Create the training loop 
4) Test on the CIFAR dataset.


Files:
1) model.py: Where the Generator and Discriminator classes will be made
2) main.py: Where the model will be trained 
3) helper_functions.py: Utility functions

(More files may be added as per requirement)
