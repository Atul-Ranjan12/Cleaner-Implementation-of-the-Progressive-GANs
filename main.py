## TODO: 1) Complete Implementation of the Generator and Discriminator block:
## TODO:        a)Implement the mixing variables, scaled weights, and Minibatch Standard Deviation
## TODO: 2) Test the Discriminator and Generator networks (Make sure that the discriminator is a complete mirror of the generator)
## TODO: 3) Implement the Training Loop and the training step.
## TODO: 4) Test it on the CIFAR Dataset and compare the results to the paper
## TODO: 5) Test on the art Dataset
